Instagram Profile Clone:
This project is a simple recreation of an Instagram profile page, developed as an introductory project for the Computer Science for Social Good (CSSG) club. 
The goal was to practice front-end fundamentals by building a familiar user interface.

Overview:
I built this to learn how to structure a webpage and style it to look like a real app. It features a profile header, user stats, and a responsive photo grid.

Tools Used:
HTML for the content and structure and CSS for the layout, specifically Flexbox and Grid to keep everything aligned.
